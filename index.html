            <div>Hi Junior Sailor Scouts! You got here just in time! The mean Queen Nehellenia locked up all my friends into a 2D prison disguised as playing cards!! I need your help to set them free. If you can find two of a kind you can get them out but we only have 2 minutes before she gets back. When youâ€™re ready to help me save the day, hit start and find everyone before the stinky mean Queen Nehellenia gets back from terrorizing other innocent people and you will help us Sailor Scouts save the day!
