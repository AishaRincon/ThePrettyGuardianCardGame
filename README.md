# Game
Hi there sailor scouts! I'm so glad that you're here. The evil Queen Nehellenia locked up all of my friends into a 2D prison disguised as playing cards! She is so EVIL, now I have no one to hang out with. Can you please help me find all of my friends? By matching two of the same cards you set them free! selecting the wrong cards will only alert stinky Queen Nehellenia so try not to make too many mistakes.
